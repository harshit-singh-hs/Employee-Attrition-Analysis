## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Employee-Attrition-Analysis
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run the notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder to perform analysis.
3. Modify `src/model_training.py` to train and evaluate models.
